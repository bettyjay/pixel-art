The project pixel art has been completed after several trials. 
The project has been challenging with some days i just did nothing but read the code and try and understand where i was going wrong and how to rectify it.
All in all I had major fun undertaking the ALC 3.0 classes and all the challenges that came with it.
It has been a long journey filled with major challenges(unrelated to coding mostly..hehe) but with the grace of God i have seen it through to the end.
Thank you Andela Learning Community and Google for giving me such an amazing opportunity.
Regards Betty, a happy student.



That was just a sidenote..
Now back to the pixel art maker..

Well, the code for this project is written in javascript, HTML and CSS languages.
file index1 contains the HTML code.
file design contains the javascript code.
whereas file style contains the css code.

I have tried and commented on the code to try and explain it a little bit.
This is it. 
goodbye.
